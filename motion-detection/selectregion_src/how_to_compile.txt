On Ubuntu: 
	- go to this directory and type make, CMakeLists.txt file will be parsed and executed. Make sure the path to opencv is correct. It depends on how you did the installation. When using macports everything should be okÃ©.

On OSX:
	- create a XCode Project and attach libraries (/opt/local/lib & /opt/local/include) to search paths in the project configuration tab/

	- or with terminal -> g++, go to the src directory and type: 

		$ g++ selectregion.cpp tinyxml.cpp tinystr.cpp tinyxmlerror.cpp tinyxmlparser.cpp `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs` -stdlib=libc++  -o selectregion
